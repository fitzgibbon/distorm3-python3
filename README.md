distorm3-python3
================

distorm3 ported to Python 3

# Installation on Windows
The setup.py is currently broken for python 3 on Windows. Instead install the distorm3 binary distribution from https://code.google.com/p/distorm/ and replace Python34/Libs/site-packages/distorm3/__init__.py with the one from this repo.
